    Each agent interacts with the environment (as defined by the `Env` class) by first observing the
    state of the environment. Based on this observation the agent changes the environment by performing
    an action.
    Do not use this abstract base class directly but instead use one of the concrete agents implemented.
    Each agent realizes a reinforcement learning algorithm. Since all agents conform to the same
    interface, you can use them interchangeably.
    To implement your own agent, you have to implement the following methods:
    - `forward`
    - `backward`
    - `compile`
    - `load_weights`
    - `save_weights`

                to follow if `nb_max_start_steps` > 0. If set to `None`, a random action is performed.
            log_interval (integer): If `verbose` = 1, the number of steps that are considered to be an interval.
